**Here are the features:**
- :bar_chart: 3 Key Metrics: I included plots and statistics to visualize these metrics.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Sub Metrics: On the right side, you'll find additional metrics for a more comprehensive view.
- :gear: Gauge Plot: This plot displays the metrics on a dial, represented in percentages.
- :world_map: User Locations: The dashboard shows user locations on a map.

**Datasets used:**
- Randomly generated data frames
- World Map

**Future Additions:**
- Text Color in Gauge Plot: It would be beneficial to change the color of the text in the Gauge plot to white, as it will enhance visibility and readability.
- Enhance responsiveness: The dashboard's responsiveness can be further enhanced to ensure an optimal user experience on different devices and screen sizes. This could involve refining the layout, font sizes, and overall design to adapt seamlessly to mobile platforms.

These additions will help elevate the functionality and usability of the dashboard. 

_Feel free to collaborate and contribute to these enhancements!_
